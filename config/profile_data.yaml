# Professional Summary
headline: "Systems Engineer | AI Architect | Founder — Building Africa's First Intelligence-Native Engineering Ecosystem"

summary: |
  I am a systems engineer, AI architect, and founder building Africa's first 
  intelligence-native engineering ecosystem. My mission is to unify Africa's 
  fractured hardware, software, and field-engineering processes into one 
  continuous, self-optimizing intelligence loop — enabling millions to design, 
  build, repair, and scale technology with unprecedented speed and clarity.
  
  I blend system design, AI agents, IoT, hardware design, and mobile/AR interfaces 
  to solve problems at continental scale. Through Precifarm AI Ltd, I'm building 
  a multi-brand engineering ecosystem that integrates AI-native development, 
  repair intelligence, and clean energy solutions.
  
  My field experience at SunCulture Kenya exposed a core insight: the hardware 
  lifecycle fails due to fragmentation — design, deployment, maintenance, repair, 
  feedback all operate in silos. Precifarm is my systemic solution.

# Personal Narrative Elements
origin_story: |
  My journey began in the fields of Kenya, working as a field engineer at SunCulture 
  where I witnessed firsthand the fragmentation plaguing Africa's hardware ecosystem. 
  Design teams in one silo, deployment in another, maintenance scattered, repair 
  ad-hoc, and feedback loops non-existent. This systemic failure sparked my mission: 
  to build the intelligence layer that unifies Africa's entire engineering lifecycle.
  
  I realized that the future isn't just about building AI — it's about building 
  AI-native systems that span hardware, software, field operations, and human 
  empowerment. Precifarm is that vision manifested.

key_achievements:
  - "Building Africa's first intelligence-native engineering ecosystem"
  - "Designed multi-agent AI architecture for hardware lifecycle automation"
  - "Created AR repair intelligence system (Neura)"
  - "Field engineering experience with solar/IoT systems serving farmers"
  - "Bridging hardware + software + AI into unified systems"

unique_value_proposition: |
  I am one of the rare founders who is simultaneously a field engineer, a multi-agent 
  AI architect, a hardware designer, a mobile/AR UX engineer, a systems thinker, 
  a growth strategist, and a sustainability-driven innovator.
  
  I don't just build products — I build continent-scale engineering intelligence 
  ecosystems. My unique combination of field experience, AI architecture expertise, 
  and hardware design skills positions me to solve problems that others can't even 
  see clearly.

career_goals: |
  Short-term: 
  - Launch Precifarm IDE beta with 1,000+ early users
  - Secure funding from top-tier investors (YC, a16z, Sequoia)
  - Deploy Neura repair intelligence to 10,000+ technicians
  
  Long-term:
  - 1B renewable engineers empowered globally
  - Multi-layered ecosystem ($4T market-cap engineering empire)
  - Africa's leading AI-native engineering platform
  - Transform the global repair economy
